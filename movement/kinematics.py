def direct_solve(q_current, target, attack=None, verbose=False):
    """ Directly compute the joint angles corresponding to a given cartesian target.

    This doesn't use the jacobian or DH formulation at all, and it makes no
    attempt at straight-line motion. Instead, it takes advantage of specific
    limitations in the arm to directly compute the final target angles that
    match the cartesian x, y, z coordinates.

    If an angle of attack is provided as a float, or a (low, high) range, then
    only that angle or range of angles will be considered. As a parameter, an
    attack angle is defined as:
      0 is parallel to the table stretching outward away from the origin,
      pi/2 is stretching up towards the sky,
      -pi/2 has the the gripper is pointing down,
      pi, or -pi, has the gripper pointing towards the origin,
      and so on.

    For the base rotation, there is a closed form solution:
    * As a special case, if (x, y) is (0, 0), then we leave the base angle
      alone, since any base angle will work. Alternatively, we could move to a
      resting base angle of 0.
    * Otherwise, if (x, y) is off the origin, there are only two base angles
      that position the arm to move within a plane passing through (x, y). These
      angles are opposite each other. If only one is a legal base angle, we
      choose that one. Otherwise, we choose whichever one puts (x, y) on the
      "forward" side, so the arm doesn't need to bend over backwards. 

    After the base rotation, the problem is reduced to 2D plane geometry. But
    there are two degrees of freedom that can lead to multiple solutions for the
    shoulder, elbow, and wrist angles. We do iterative optimization to solve
    this numerically.
    * First, is the angle of attack: we need to consider all possible angles at
      which the grabber might be oriented towards the target point, e.g. grabber
      oriented down to the target from above, or up from from below, or grabber
      positioned to the side or wfrom some angle.
    * Second, given some attack angle, we can geometrically solve for the
      shoulder and elbow angles. There maybe two solutions to these equations,
      corresponding to an "elbow convex" or "elbow concave" orientation:

                      ._-x                        x
                   o-'                            |
                   |  convex                     ,o   concave
                   |  "up"                    ,-'     "down"
                   O                         O
    * Given the shoulder and elbow angles, and the attack angle, the wrist angle
      can be calculated directly.
    Given these degrees of freedom, we always choose convex, if available, and
    from among all possible convex solutions, we choose an attack angle such
    that the three joint angles are closest to their resting 0 points, e.g.
    minimizing the sum of squares of the angles.

    It returns a sequence of It returns a list of joint angle vectors, q_0, q_1,
    q_2, ..., q_N, forming a path to reach the target.

      * Each q_i is a legal configuration of joint angles, within the joint
        limits.
      * Each q_(i+i) is reachable from q_i directly by a legal and small
        movement of the joints, and similarly q_0 is reachable from the current
        position q_current directly by a legal and small movement of the joints.
      * q_N is at the target, within some reasonable margin of error.
      * The overall path from q_current, to q_0, to q_1, ..., to q_N, is
        reasonably short.

    The idea is the that we can just call set_position_radians(qi) for i=0 to N,
    with some suitable delay between each to allow time for movement.
