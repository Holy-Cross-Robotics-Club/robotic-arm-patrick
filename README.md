# Patrick: The Witty Robotic Arm

What do you do when you gain access to a $200 robotic arm from Amazon? Gamify it of course!

We strap a camera on the xArm 1s and see what it can do.

As the first major project of the Holy Cross Robotics Club, Patrick the Witty Robotic Arm will combine machine learning, computer vision, and game design to be your fiercest rival in interactive games.

If you're interested in this project, feel free to follow along. Code will be updated frequently on this repository. If you're interested in contributing, reach out to me at bbmcca26@g.holycross.edu.
